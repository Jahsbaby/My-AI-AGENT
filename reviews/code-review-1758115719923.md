Reviewing the code changes in `../my-agent/index.ts`:

### `index.ts`

**Summary of Changes:**
- Imported `formatDate` from `./utils/date`.
- Added a `console.log` statement to print "Today's date is:" along with the formatted date.

**Feedback:**

1.  **New `console.log` Statement:**
    *   **Comment:** The line `console.log("Today's date is:", formatDate());` has been added.
    *   **Suggestion:** Please clarify the purpose of this `console.log`.
        *   If it's for temporary debugging, it should be removed before merging.
        *   If it serves a functional purpose (e.g., logging important startup information), consider using a proper logging framework instead of `console.log` for better control over log levels, destinations, and formatting in a production environment.

2.  **Import of `formatDate`:**
    *   **Comment:** The introduction of `formatDate` from `./utils/date` is a good practice. It suggests that date formatting logic is encapsulated in a dedicated utility, which improves modularity and reusability.
    *   **Observation:** While I don't have access to the content of `./utils/date.ts`, the import itself looks correct.

**Overall:**
The changes are minimal. The primary point of feedback is to understand and decide on the permanence of the new `console.log` statement. The introduction of a date utility is a positive step for code organization.
