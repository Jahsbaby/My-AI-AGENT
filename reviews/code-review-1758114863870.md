I couldn't retrieve any file changes from the `../my-agent` directory. The `getFileChangesInDirectoryTool` returned an empty response.

This could mean:
*   There are no uncommitted or staged changes in that directory.
*   The directory path `../my-agent` is incorrect or inaccessible from my current context.

Could you please confirm the directory path or ensure there are actual changes present that you'd like me to review?
